module RubyTerraform
  module Commands
    # Wraps the +terraform apply+ command which creates or updates
    # infrastructure according to terraform configuration files in the provided
    # directory.
    #
    # By default, terraform will generate a new plan and present it for approval
    # before taking any action. Alternatively, the command accepts a plan file
    # created by a previous invocation, in which case terraform will take the
    # actions described in that plan without any confirmation prompt.
    #
    # For options accepted on construction, see {#initialize}.
    #
    # When executing an instance of {Apply} via {#execute}, the following
    # options are supported:
    #
    # * +:directory+: the path to a directory containing terraform
    #   configuration (deprecated in terraform 0.14, removed in terraform 0.15,
    #   use +:chdir+ instead).
    # * +:plan+: the path to a pre-computed plan to be applied.
    # * +:chdir+: the path of a working directory to switch to before executing
    #   the given subcommand.
    # * +:auto_approve+: if +true+, skips interactive approval of the generated
    #   plan before applying; defaults to +false+.
    # * +:backup+: the path to backup the existing state file before modifying;
    #   defaults to the +:state_out+ path with +".backup"+ extension; set
    #   +:no_backup+ to +true+ to skip backups entirely.
    # * +:compact_warnings+: when +true+, if terraform produces any warnings
    #   that are not accompanied by errors, they are shown in a more compact
    #   form that includes only the summary messages; defaults to +false+.
    # * +:input+: when +false+, will not ask for input for variables not
    #   directly set; defaults to +true+.
    # * +:lock+: when +true+, locks the state file when locking is supported;
    #   when +false+, does not lock the state file; defaults to +true+.
    # * +:lock_timeout+: the duration to retry a state lock; defaults to +"0s"+.
    # * +:no_backup+: when +true+, no backup file will be written; defaults to
    #   +false+.
    # * +:no_color+: whether or not the output from the command should be in
    #   color; defaults to +false+.
    # * +:parallelism+: the number of parallel resource operations; defaults to
    #   +10+.
    # * +:refresh+: when +true+, updates state prior to checking for
    #   differences; when +false+ uses locally available state; defaults to
    #   +true+; this has no effect when +:plan+ is provided.
    # * +:replace+: force replacement of a particular resource instance using
    #   its resource address. If the apply would've normally produced an update
    #   or no-op action for this instance, Terraform will replace it instead.
    # * +:replaces+: an array of resource addresses to replace; if both
    #   +replace+ and +replaces+ are provided, all resources will be replaced.
    # * +:state+: the path to the state file from which to read state and in
    #   which to store state (unless +:state_out+ is specified); defaults to
    #   +"terraform.tfstate"+.
    # * +:state+: the path to the state file from which to read state and in
    #   which to store state (unless +:state_out+ is specified); defaults to
    #   +"terraform.tfstate"+.
    # * +:state_out+: the path to write state to that is different than
    #   +:state+; this can be used to preserve the old state.
    # * +:target+: the address of a resource to target; if both +:target+ and
    #   +:targets+ are provided, all targets will be passed to terraform.
    # * +:targets+: an array of resource addresses to target; if both +:target+
    #   and +:targets+ are provided, all targets will be passed to terraform.
    # * +:vars+: a map of variables to be passed to the terraform configuration.
    # * +:var_file+: the path to a terraform var file; if both +:var_file+ and
    #   +:var_files+ are provided, all var files will be passed to terraform.
    # * +:var_files+: an array of paths to terraform var files; if both
    #   +:var_file+ and +:var_files+ are provided, all var files will be passed
    #   to terraform.
